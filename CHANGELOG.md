# v1.0.1
- The native binary wasn't being pulled from s3 so I needed to update the build

# v1.0.0
- Update to GemFire 9.2
- Update to Node 8.11.3
- Add CacheFactory to enable developer to dynamically create the connection to the distributed system.

# v0.1.19
- Use ForceSet instead of Set to allow for node 0.11.x+ compatibility

# v0.1.18
- Tested with 8.1.0.0 and consider that the new default.

# v0.0.18
- **Breaking Change**: `region.get` and `region.put` now work as before. `region.getSync` and `region.putSync` replace previous synchronous behavior.
- Added `region.getAllSync` and `region.putAllSync`

# v0.0.17
- **Breaking Change**: `region.get` and `region.put` now work synchronously when not given a callback. `region.put` will no longer emit an event given an invalid value and no callback. If RangeErrors or stack overflows occur with usage you may need to utilize `process.nextTick(callback)` or `setImmediate(callback)`;

# v0.0.16
- `cache.executeFunction()` and `region.executeFunction()` now take a synchronous flag option.

# v0.0.15
- `cache.executeQuery()` now takes parameters as an optional second argument. See api.md for usage. 

# v0.0.14
- **Breaking Change**: `region.keys()` now hits the local cache. Use `region.serverKeys()` for previous behavior.
- Added `region.serverKeys()` to obtain the list of keys on the server
- Added `region.values()` to obtain the list of values in local cache
- Added `region.entries()` to obtain the list of key-value pairs in local cache

# v0.0.13
- Performance optimization for region.put() with objects, and v8-to-gemfire string conversion.

# v0.0.12
- Improve error objects. GemFire errors now have a `name` property describing the type of error and a `message` property with the original message. We no longer interpolate the name into the error message.

# v0.0.11
- Add `poolName` option to cache.createRegion()
- **Breaking Change**: cache.executeFunction and cache.executeQuery renamed their options from `pool` to `poolName` to be consistent with the rest of the API.

# v0.0.10
- Add ability to target a particular GemFire pool when executing a function using `cache.executeQuery`

# v0.0.9
- Add `gemfire.connected()`

# v0.0.8

- **Breaking Change**: `new gemfire.Cache()` constructor removed, replaced with `gemfire.configure()` and `gemfire.getCache()`
- **Breaking Change**: JavaScript Arrays are now sent to GemFire as the Java type `ArrayList` instead of `Object[]`.
- Add `cache.createRegion()`
- Add `region.destroyRegion()` and `region.localDestroyRegion()`
- Add ability to target a particular GemFire pool when executing a function using `cache.executeFunction`
- Add `region.attributes`

# v0.0.7

- Require GemFire Native Client 8.0.0.1 or later
- Add workaround for issue where `cache.executeFunction()` throws `apache::geode::client::NullPointerException` if no regions have been defined in the XML configuration.
- Fix issue where arrays would sometimes come back from GemFire as corrupted non-array objects.

# v0.0.6

- Adjust workaround for the issue where arrays could not be consistently round-tripped when attached to an object retrieved from GemFire. Note that this workaround, while more reliable, likely degrades performance and most likely won't be necessary when the next release of GemFire comes out.

# v0.0.5

- Fix issue where some arrays would throw `apache::geode::client::OutOfBoundsException` when attached to an object retrieved from GemFire.

# v0.0.4

- Fix issue where `region.putAll({"1": "one"}, callback)` would incorrectly use Number keys instead of String keys.

# v0.0.3

- Initial Cache API
- Initial Region API
